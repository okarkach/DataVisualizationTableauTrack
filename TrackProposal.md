# **Data Visualization with Tableau**

Data Visualization using BI Tools is key to exploring complex problems visually, reporting your findings to stakeholders at all levels, and operationalizing your data models. In this track, you will learn to confidently use Tableau, Tableau prep, TabPy, and others to enhance your data storytelling toolbox by creating interactive Dashboards.

**Thought:** 

As a result of the recent aquisition of Tableau by Salesforce, a focus on the integration of the two platforms could be a good candidate for a Tutorial or a whole module on how to connect Salesforce with Tableau and use the CRM objects to create dynamic Dashboards for real time access to reports. Future annoucements on the strategic plans of Salesforce for Tableau would need to be closely monitored to update this content.
